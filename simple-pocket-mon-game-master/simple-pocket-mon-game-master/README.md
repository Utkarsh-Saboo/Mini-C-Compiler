# Simple-PocketMon-Game

Simple-pocketmon-game using Finite Automata model. And this game is only console.<br>
This repository is made for compiler lecture's report, but I want to refer this repo to understand FA model.


## How to use

- In window, input the below command. <br>
- Or download [this file](https://github.com/KeonHeeLee/simple-pocket-mon-game/blob/master/pocketmon.exe).
```
$ pocketmon.exe
```


### Note!

- This repo seperate [cpp files](https://github.com/KeonHeeLee/simple-pocket-mon-game/tree/master/src) and [header files](https://github.com/KeonHeeLee/simple-pocket-mon-game/tree/master/include).
- If you want to compile this program, in visual studio(window), you must collect this files in one directory.


## Finite Automata(FA) Model

- NFA (Non-deterministric Finite Automata) Model

- DFA (Deterministric Finite Automata) Model

## Result

- FA(Finite Automata) is very useful to develop NPC in games.
- This is only simple game example, but FA model's size is likely to be very big in big-sized game.
